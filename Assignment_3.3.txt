1. Components of hadoop 2.X:
   
   Hadoop 2.x has three major components:
        * HDFS
        * YARN
        * MAPREDUCE
   HDFS:
     * Stands for Hadoop Distributed File System
     * It is also known as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x
     * It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture
     * It is a java based file system that provides scalable and reliable data storage
     * It was desinged to span large clusters of commodity servers
   YARN:
     * Stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator

   MAPREDUCE:
     * It is a Batch Processing or Distributed Data Processing Module
     * It is also known as "MR V1" as it is part of hadoop 1.x with some updated features
     * Its job is to split the input data set into independent chunks which are processed by the map tasks in a completely parallel manner
     * The framwork sorts the output of the maps ,which are then input to the reduce tasks
